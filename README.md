## What

### Wallet Service of an e-commerce micro-service application

> A distributed e-commerce service is made by many parts which perform some independent tasks. All of these
> parts, communicating with each other, contribute to make the entire system works.
> One of them is a service that represents the Wallet. Each customer, in order to make orders related to one
> or more products, should have a Wallet. It handles the customer money and keeps track of customer
> transactions.

## How (until now)
- **Kotlin**
